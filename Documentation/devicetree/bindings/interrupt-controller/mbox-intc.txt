Mailbox-backed Interrupt Controller
===================================

This binding represents an interrupt controller implemented in firmware,
that uses a mailbox channel to signal and acknowledge interrupts.

Device Node:
============

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Must be one of the following strings:
			- allwinner,sunxi-msgbox-intc
- interrupt-controller:	Signifies that this node is an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells:	Must be 1.
- mboxes:		phandle for the mailbox controller and channel
			specifier. If the mailbox controller has unidirectional
			channels, two entries are required (see below).
- mbox-names:		Only required for unidirectional mailbox channels. In
			that case, it must contain the strings "tx" and "rx"
			(where "tx" and "rx" are from Linux's perspective, not
			the direction the interrupts are traveling).

Example:
--------

	msgbox_intc: interrupt-controller {
		compatible = "allwinner,sunxi-msgbox-intc";
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		mboxes = <&msgbox 6>, <&msgbox 7>;
		mbox-names = "tx", "rx";
	};
