Allwinner sunxi Message Box
===========================

The hardware message box on sunxi SoCs is a two-user mailbox controller
containing 8 unidirectional FIFOs bonded into 4 bidirectional mailbox channels.
An interrupt is raised for received messages, but software must poll to know
when a transmitted message has been acknowledged by the remote user.

Refer to ./mailbox.txt for generic information about mailbox device-tree
bindings.

Mailbox Device Node:
====================

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Must contain at least "allwinner,sun6i-a31-msgbox".
			Should also contain another SoC-specific string when
			used on other SoCs which are compatible, e.g.
			- allwinner,sun8i-h3-msgbox
			- allwinner,sun50i-a64-msgbox
- reg:			Contains the mailbox register address range (base
			address and length).
- clocks:		phandle for the clock controller and specifier.
- resets:		phandle for the reset controller and specifier.
- interrupts:		Contains interrupt information for the mailbox.
- #mbox-cells		Must be 2 - the indexes of the transmit and receive
			channels, respectively.

Example:
--------

	msgbox: mailbox@1c17000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-msgbox",
		             "allwinner,sun6i-a31-msgbox";
		reg = <0x01c17000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_MSGBOX>;
		resets = <&ccu RST_BUS_MSGBOX>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 49 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#mbox-cells = <2>;
	};
